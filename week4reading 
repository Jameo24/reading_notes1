# Troubleshooting 

This article was a guideline on how you should troubleshoot.
It spoke on how theory is used and how you should alwys have a plan B, C, and D when trouble shooting. I like how they expressed that if your plan of action doesnt work it is okay to elevate the issue to a superior if it is a critical problem. In its entirety it reads as troubleshooting is a acquired skill but you are not alone if you are unable to figure out the issue. Teamwork makes the dreamwork.
