# SSD Data recovery and how to erase a hard drive using DBAN

SSD or solid state drive recovery was interesting to me because these companies charge so much to recover your data and I see now that they dont do that much work to retrieve your data. I need to have some data retrieved off of 3 hard drive of mine that crashed doing an OS update. D

DBAN or dariks boot and nuke is a good read since I have never heard of  this process for destruction. The militarty uses this and does 7 passes to solidify destructioin has been completed. I like how it gives the warning that this software irrecoverably destroys data. It sounds beyond important and a clear indication of do not mess this up.
