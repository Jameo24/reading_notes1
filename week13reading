#Cloud Virtualization with AWS

This topic was interesting because it shows how advanced technonolgy has gotten. Cloud based is definitely the future and comes with more vulnerabilitues but also more mobility. I like how you can set things up virtually and delete or upload as you need them. It basically makes you a swiss army knife when it comes to hacking or protecting.
