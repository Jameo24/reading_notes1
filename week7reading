#Powershell

This article discussed the differnces between Powershell and Bash. The differences were not much but I did not know there is so many programs you can use to write code. C++, Java, Python, Powershell and the list goes on. I feel like i have stumbled onto a whole new world. Bash is what we started to use in class and we progressed to powershell.I like powershell for the automation and how it runs behind the GUI on a CPu to me its like the secret sauce to a recipe.
