#How to remove malware from your windows PC

This topic discussed malware and how to attempt to eradicate it. It showed a program called Malwarebytes. I have never heard of it but it provided screenshots and it seems easy to use. It also discussed how easy it is or was to access safe mode on Windows 7 and 8 and that the process is more tedious from Windows 10 and above.
